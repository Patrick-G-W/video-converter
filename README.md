# Video converter using ffmpeg and youtube-dl
Can convert mp4, flv, webm, ogg, mkv, avi and raw.

Simply run the file from command and enter the link to the video, then specify output format, and then output name.

Will create the file in the index.py location.

Should be able to download almost any video because of youtube-dl.

This is a mini project that I am doing in my spare time while at uni, don't expect anything great. This was originaly going to be a way for me to learn how to create GUIs in Python, but turned into a proper project.
